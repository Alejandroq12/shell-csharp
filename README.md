["Build a Shell" Challenge]

In this challenge, I will build my own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, I'll learn about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

# Running the project:

1. Ensure you have `dotnet (9.0)` installed locally
2. Run `./shell.sh` to run this program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.cs`.
